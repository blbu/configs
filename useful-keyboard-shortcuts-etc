##Keyboard Shortcuts
I like to have these set. Haven't run into too many conflicts.

Control+Alt+T -> New Terminal
Only really use to when starting for the day
(use Control+Shift+N to get a new terminal when already have one up.)

Alt+W -> Switch Windows of Current Application
Useful to bounce between left and right terminal.
Faster than Alt+Escape, which moves between all Application Windows.

##!-related bash things
!!
  repeat last command
!xyz
  repeat last command beginning with xyz
!xyz:p
  print the command that would be executed
  (adds to history --- execute with !!)

##Some Bash Movements
(^ means "the control key")
^a
  go to start of line
^e
  go to end of line
^k
  erase until end of line
^u
  erase until start of line
^w
  erase word

##A smidge of Bash Expansion
touch {a,b,c}.c
  touches a.c, b.b, c.c
  you can nest these --- be careful though

##Vim pasting trick
:set paste
  Now you can paste without the autoindenting breaking everything
  turn it off with :set nopaste
