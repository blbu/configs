##Keyboard Shortcuts
I like to have these set. Haven't run into too many conflicts.

Control+Alt+T -> New Terminal
Only really use to when starting for the day
(use Control+Shift+N to get a new terminal when already have one up.)

Alt+W -> Switch Windows of Current Application
Useful to bounce between left and right terminal.
Faster than Alt+Escape, which moves between all Application Windows.

###Mac OS X
I have been using this as my primary workstation O/S. Globally-recognised
shortcuts are very handy.

Control+Left-arrow-key -> Move left one Desktop
Control+Right-arrow-key -> Move right one Desktop

##!-related bash things
!!
  repeat last command
!xyz
  repeat last command beginning with xyz
!xyz:p
  print the command that would be executed
  (adds to history --- execute with !!)

###!$
!$
  gets the last argument of the previous command. I use this far too often,
especially when shuttling a single file between multiple iteractive GUIs.

## '^^' substitution
~$ echo "moo"
moo
~$ ^moo^bark
echo "bark"
bark
~$

## n-th argument
~$ echo "here" "are some" "arguments"
here are some arguments
~$ echo !!:2
echo "are some"
are some
~$

Accepts ranges, negative indices, etc.
!!:-2
!!:2-3

It's relatively self-explanatory.

##Some Bash Movements
(^ means "the control key")
^a
  go to start of line
^e
  go to end of line
^k
  erase until end of line
^u
  erase until start of line
^w
  erase word

##A smidge of Bash Expansion
touch {a,b,c}.c
  touches a.c, b.b, c.c
  you can nest these --- be careful though

##Vim pasting 'trick'
:set paste
  Now you can paste without the autoindenting breaking everything
  turn it off with :set nopaste

##iTerm 2 use META keys (word-by-word nagivation)
iTerm2 --> Preferences --> Profiles --> Keys -->
Left option key acts as Meta+Esc
